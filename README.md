# Kin Insurance Front End Interview Challenge

After over a month of interviews with Kin Insurance, I recieved a rejection saying I was impressive but not a "perfect fit at this time". This was after 5+ days between emails and me putting in a lot of effort on the challenge and interviews. 

I've decided to make their challenge public so they can also waste some time building a new challenge if this happens to get seen. I would rather share what I have worked on then keep it in a private repo so potential employers can view it. 

The web application itself was fun to build as they requested no frameworks and to use pure javascript/TypeScript. It was a great throwback to building apps before web frameworks became widely used. 

Below are the steps to build and run the application.
